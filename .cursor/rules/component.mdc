# Component Rules

- Not include any business logic
- Define style variants with class-variance-authority
- Use TypeScript for prop types
- Use the `cn()` utility for class merging
- Follow a single responsibility principle
- Be properly exported with clear, descriptive names
- Keep base components framework-agnostic (no HTMX/Alpine.js specific logic)
- Pass framework-specific attributes through props
